Artifactory Skip Replication User Plugin
========================================

This plugin disables replication to another Artifactory instance for non-jar files.

NOTES: `artifactory-user-plugins-devenv` will fail due to a test requirement of two artifactory instances. Must manually set up an extra instance at `localhost:8081/artifactory` for testing.
